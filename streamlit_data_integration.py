    This module will enable automated data pulls from sources like:
    - **GSA CALC**: to retrieve hourly labor rates for specific labor categories.
    - **FPDS.gov**: to obtain historical contract award information, including values and set-asides.
    - **SAM.gov** (optional): for recent solicitations and acquisition strategies.

    ✅ **Coming Soon**: AI-driven market analysis using this integrated data.

    In future updates, data will be used to auto-tune recommended PTW bill rates and forecast competitor pricing behaviors.
